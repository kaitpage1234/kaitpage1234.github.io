	<p style=text-align:center> Currently, I am in my second semester of my freshman year at The University of Maine. I started out as an Elementary Education major, but recently switched to Business Marketing and I love it so far. I am taking BUA 101, BUA 235, MAT 115, ECO 120 and CMJ 103. I love UMaine as a school and have made many great friends here. Being from Maine myself, I also am really close to home. All in all, I am glad I chose The University of Maine
